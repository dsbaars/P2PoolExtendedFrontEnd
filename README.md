P2PoolImprovedFrontEnd
====================

Improved version of P2PoolExtendedFrontend.
By:
- Using Bootstrap 3 with proper classes (no-inline CSS)
- Code separation for JavaScripts (in first stage, only moved to separate files now)
- Shows pool-fee and last blocks on home-dashboard

hardcpp did a great job creating a improved UI, but didn't use Bootstrap (2) properly, so adding stuff was very hacky. I hope this improved version helps other pool-owners to customize their p2pool stats easier.

How to install
====================
Put all these files on web-static folder of your p2pool node installation
